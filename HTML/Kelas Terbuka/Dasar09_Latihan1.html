        <h1> Harry Potter (character) </h1>
        <hr>
        <p><dfn><b>Harry James Potter</b></dfn> is a fictional character and the titular protagonist in J. K. Rowling's series of eponymous novels. The majority of the books' plot covers seven years in the life of the <em>orphan</em> Harry, who, on his eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard. Thus, he attends <abbr title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (/ˈhɒɡwɔːrts/)"><u>Hogwarts</u></abbr> to practise magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors along with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community, and that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort – the internationally feared Dark Wizard and murderer of his parents, James and Lily Potter. The book and film series revolve around Harry's struggle to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort.
        <br>
        Harry is regarded as a <u>fictional icon</u> and has been described by many critics, readers, and audiences as one of the greatest literary and film characters of all time. He was portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe in all eight Harry Potter films from Philosopher's Stone (2001) to Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011)</p>

        <h4>Establishment</h4>
        <p>Founded around the 9th century and 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin, Hogwarts was established in the Highlands of Scotland to educate young wizards and witches as well as to keep students safe from Muggle persecution. Theory has it that Rowena Ravenclaw came up with the name of Hogwarts after dreaming of a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a lake. <sup>[4]</sup> Since then, Hogwarts educated most wizarding children with residence in Great Britain and Ireland, keeping its location hidden from other wizarding schools and Muggles</p>

        <h4>Middle Ages</h4>
        <p>About 300 years after the school was founded, the Triwizard Tournament was established as an interscholastic competition among the three most prestigious magical schools in Europe: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. The tournament continued for six centuries before being discontinued. An attempt was made in the 1994–1995 school year to revive the tournament, but the consequential death of Cedric Diggory resulted in its permanent <em>discontinuation</em>.</p>

        <p>Hogwarts is a <strong>coeducational</strong>, secondary boarding school, taking children from ages eleven to eighteen,<sup>[6]</sup> in line with real-world combined secondary and sixth form institutions in Britain. Education at Hogwarts is not compulsory, with some students being home schooled as stated in the seventh book. Rowling initially said there are about one thousand students at Hogwarts. <sup>[7]</sup> She later suggested around six hundred, while acknowledging that this number was still <em>inconsistent</em> with the small number of people in Harry's year. She further explained that this had resulted from her creating only forty characters for Harry's year. <sup>[8]</sup></p>
